The car recommendation system, developed as a group project in Python, utilizes advanced techniques in graph theory and decision trees to provide personalized car suggestions. By representing car features and user preferences as nodes and edges in a graph, the system efficiently navigates through various options to find optimal matches. Decision trees further refine these recommendations by considering multiple criteria such as budget, brand, fuel efficiency, and user reviews. This combination ensures accurate and user-specific car recommendations, enhancing the decision-making process for potential buyers.
